This directory is for work on the Boston legal code.   The MIT Media Lab, Human Dynamics team is working with City of Boston, OpenGov Foundation and Code for America Boston Brigade to ETL the Boston legal code into USLM format.  

The first step is using the OpenGov Foundation parser to get the Boston code into State Decoded format and then to use the approach OpenGov Foundation has developed to accomplish the last step to transform the Boston code into USLM format.  

It is also planned to have a DC Code version of the Bosotn code so as to better evaluate and take advantage of the DC tools and features.
